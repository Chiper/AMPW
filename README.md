ABSTRACT
In this paper covers the development of power management devices (PMD) for powering sensors acoustic emission (AE). This device is part of a 16-channel acoustic emission monitoring respiratory pipeline nuclear power stations (NPS) allowing development to identify defects at an early stage of their origin, reducing the risk of sudden failure of the pipeline system.
